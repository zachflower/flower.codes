## Slow The Fuck Down

## Take Responsiblity

> "Far too often we let little things slide. But just turn on the news and listen as the anchors lament an auto-part defect leading to deaths and multibillion-dollar recalls or a small leak in a gas pipeline causing an explosion that endangers wildlife. Recognizing when something is wrong, big or small, and holding people accountable can save industries billions and citizens their lives. Sergeant Bowen instilled in me instantly that if you do walk by a mistake, then you just set a new, lower standard." — General Ann Dunwoody, [A Higher Standard](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/a-higher-standard/15637943/?resultid=857828ea-688a-4c71-9d0d-d781ddede3ae#edition=18971175&idiq=24068799)

## Embrace The Journey

## Seek Objective Truths

## Cultivate Compassion

> "Genuine compassion is based on the rationale that all human beings have an innate desire to be happy and overcome suffering, \[...\] they have the natural right to fulfill this fundamental aspiration." — His Holiness The Dalai Lama,[The Art of Happiness](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-art-of-happiness-a-handbook-for-living-by-dalai-lama-xiv/245744/)

## Do Good Work

> "Work ought not to be merely a bone thrown to the otherwise unemployed. \[...\] work ought to be necessary; it ought to be good; it ought to be satisfying and dignifying to the people who do it, and genuinely useful and pleasing to the people for whom it is done." — Wendell Berry [Another Turn of the Crank](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/another-turn-of-the-crank-essays_wendell-berry/372608/item/#edition=3242441&idiq=2733773)
