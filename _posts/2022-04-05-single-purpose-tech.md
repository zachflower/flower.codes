What is it about smartphones that make them the most useful technology ever
created, while at the same time being the single-largest source of brain drain
and anxiety in existence?

I'll admit, my relationship with technology has always been borderline unhealthy,
at best, but it wasn't until I started keeping a bonafide supercomputer on my
person at all times that I crossed whole-hog into the land of addiction.

But, I'm not alone. I know this.

Having access to the world's information (and misinformation) at the touch of a
button (or, more conveniently, the swipe of a finger) has cultivated in me a
slowly depleting attention span, hair-trigger emotional response, and a general
sense of unease about the "real" world.

It's awful.

Thanks to 2020, the year where everything and nothing happened all at once, we
got a new word added to our collective lexicon that made it clear just how bad
things have gotten: doomscrolling.

Now, everyone knows what doomscrolling is by now, so I won't get into it (and, in
case you're new to the 'ole webbed site, I've
[written a bit](/2020/12/14/get-a-typewriter-write-a-friend.html) about my own
experiences with it before), but my point stands that we are simply *too
connected*, and have *too much access* to information to stay sane anymore. Our
technology simply does *too fucking much* to be healthy.

Don't get me wrong, I love the internet (or, at least, I love what the internet
represents), but I reveled in the excitement of technology for the first 25 years
of my life without devolving into a tightly wrapped ball of anxiety that spent
an embarrassing amount of my waking hours hours staring at the glowing rectangle
surgically attached to my hand.

The thing is, I'm starting to realize that the problem isn't the device, but
rather it's lack of defined purpose. Back in my day (ugh), a phone was just a
phone, the TV delivered most of my video entertainment, the internet was quite
literally chained to the family computer, and music came on tapes, then CDs, and
(when we got really fancy) MP3 players.

You know what all these things have in common?

They each *do one thing, and do it well*.

Over the last few months, I've started falling back in love with my single-purpose
tech. If I'm not reading a physical book, I reach for the e-reader rather than
the tablet. The television is the destination for entertainment again, not my
phone. I make an effort to listen to music on dedicated devices with intention,
instead of always going straight to \<insert streaming service here\>. I even
revived an old laptop for the purposes of writing, which requires nothing more
than a terminal and `vim` installed. I can't replace *everything* in my life with
single-purpose solutions, but I am sure as hell trying to be more intentional in
my choice of tooling.

While I've good and kicked my doomscrolling habit thanks to content blockers,
life hacks, and some self-discipline, the smartphone is still an ever-present
threat to my inner peace. It's always there, begging to be picked up and used.
Only by putting it in a drawer and walking out of the damn room can I silence its
siren song, which is great, but makes owning a phone effectively useless.

And, you know what?

There's almost no middle ground anymore. You can't just *own
a phone*. Believe me, I've tried. I spent the better part of the summer of 2021
with nothing but a Nokia feature phone, and it was *almost* great. You know what
you can't do without a smartphone in the 2020's? Pay for parking, pick your kids
up from school, or read a damned restaurant menu.

But that's a problem for another post.
