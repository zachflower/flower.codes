This last spring, my daughter expressed an interest in learning about computers—how they work, how to use them, what they're made of. A lifelong computer geek myself, I jumped at the opportunity to bond with her over something that I have always been passionate about. I suggested that we build a computer "from scratch" and her excitement over that idea was explosive.

So, over the last few months, we've been going about scrimping and scrounging for parts in thrift stores, eBay, and (of course) the giant box of "electronic things I can't seem to throw away" in my basement. It took a little while to get everything together, but four months and ~$100 later, we had everything we needed to build her computer.

Before I continue, I should mention that kids these days don't seem to be learning computer skills nearly as organically as those of my own generation did. For us, computers quickly became ubiquitous more than a decade before smartphones. Thanks to low bandwidth availability and shared resources, text wasn't just the preferred medium of communication—it was pretty much the only one.

This meant that we learned how to type, use a mouse, and search the web through our own natural exploration, rather than formal education or training. The untamed internet, while untrusted by parents and teachers in varying capacities, became our schoolhouse.

As far as learning goes, curiosity is the most effective teacher; so once we finished building her computer, I set about trying to find a kid-friendly search engine that enabled exploration, while still protecting her from the toxicity of the greater modern web.

And, guess what?

I failed.

You know what there is a surprising dearth of? High quality, kid-friendly search engines. Don't get me wrong, it's not as if there are _no_ kid-friendly search engines, but the ones that exist are _loaded_ with ads and powered by Google.

Being the most popular search provider in the world, I'm not particularly bothered by Google powering these search engines (aside from the obvious privacy reasons), but what concerns me is the methodology with which the results are displayed.

Here's the thing... Google has the largest advertising platform on the internet, and it is _not_ designed for children. If my kids want to search for dinosaurs, they should be presented with educational and otherwise appropriate websites to help them learn about dinosaurs; not a full page of ads for dinosaurs before they see the actual search results.

I know, I could just install an ad blocker to handle this scenario, but that is entirely beside the point.
