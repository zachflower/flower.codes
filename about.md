Hello, I'm Zach.

Iâ€™ve been developing software professionally since 2010 (unprofessionally since 2003), and in that time I have had the good fortune to build some awesome things for some [great companies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachflower).

After graduating from the University of Colorado at Boulder with a degree in Computer Science, I took a job as a broadcast engineer with Omnibus Systems. While the job afforded me the opportunity to work on the [cutting edge](/assets/starz.pdf) of the industry with companies like Starz Entertainment, DirecTV, E! Studios, and FOX Broadcasting, I wasn't writing software like I studied to do. After about a year at Omnibus, I got my first software development job at name.com and spent the next five years working my way through the Boulder startup scene as a developer at several Techstars and Foundry Group portfolio companies.

Currently, I lead backend development at [Emerson Stone](http://emersonstone.com), a design and branding agency in Boulder, CO, and am also a contributing writer for both [Fixate IO](http://fixate.io) and [TechTarget](http://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Zachary-Flower).

I'm also the founder of the [MUD Coders Guild](https://mudcoders.com/), a small community of text-based game development hobbyist, and tend to spend my free time poking around with new technologies, contributing to open source, and building unique creative [projects](/categories/projects).
