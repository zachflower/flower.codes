I've been pretty ~~consistently~~ inconsistently posting on this blog in one way or another for the last 11 years (probably more, but my memory is as good as my backups). Some of it is pretty good, some less so, but I hope that overall it shows some growth.

If you like what I've written, I'd love to hear from you. If you don't, I'd still love to hear from you, because I like writing, and would like to continue to get better at it. Either way, I hope you get _some_ value out of some of what I've posted over the years.

I know I have.
