title: '"Collecting" Obsolete Technology'

Like many technologists out there (see: nerds), I have an inordinate amount of
obsolete technology that I can't seem to make use of, nor part ways with. The
thought of wasting perfectly good gadgets is a painful one, and not the least
bit unsustainable.

There are enough old smartphones and laptops in our landfills as it is, to be
perfectly honest. But, that begs the question: what the hell do I *do* with
these things?

At last tally, I have three early-aughts desktop computers, three end-of-life
Android phones, 15 *very* small hard disk drives, an early-generation Chrome-
book, two unsupported iPads, one each of an old iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPod
Classic, all of the Rokus, every video game system ever made, more dead smart-
home accessories than I can count, a chest of Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, a Palm
Pilot of all things, and a partridge in a pear tree.

Over the years, my desire to have the latest gadget has been mostly tempered
by the decrease of privacy inherent in every modern tech product and a desire
to make more conscientious choices about how I live my life; but, seriously...
what the hell?

It's all such a waste.
