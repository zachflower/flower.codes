title: What's in a Narrator?

I started listening to Andy Weir's "Project Hail Mary" [0] audiobook
today, and I have to say that Ray Porter is the single-best
audiobook narrator in the business. The guy brings so much
personality to his work that there is a marked difference between
reading a book yourself and listening to one *performed* by Mr.
Porter.

I first heard Ray when I picked up the Bobiverse [1] series -- a
fantastic sci-fi series by Dennis Taylor that is hilarious and
creative -- and have sought out his work ever since. The man is a
storyteller in the truest sense of the word.

Is it weird to have a favorite audiobook narrator? Because I do.

If anything, when it comes to audiobooks, a good writer is almost
secondary to a good narrator. Kind of like how the way a song makes
you *feel* can be a lot more important than the lyrics themselves...

Maybe I'm just overthinking it, though.
