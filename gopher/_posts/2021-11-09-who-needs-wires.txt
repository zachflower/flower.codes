I revived my old Linksys WRT54G the other day.

With a little help from dd-wrt, I powered my home network with it nearly 20 years ago, but thanks to improvements in wireless speeds eventually retired it to the 'ole "boxed hoard of cable and gadgets."

Not being one to let good gear go to waste, I realized that it was a perfect solution for increasing the usability of some of my early-aughts gadgets. Laptops, Pocket PCs, Palm Pilots... thanks to an obsolete wireless router *already* running some quality custom firmware, I could get them all back online.

Now, don't get me wrong, I know the web isn't exactly a safe place for vintage technology, but there's nothing more satisfying than playing a MUD on an old Windows laptop from the comfort of my couch, no network cables required.

And with that revelation, I'm off to drink a Surge and slay a few more kobolds before Home Room.
