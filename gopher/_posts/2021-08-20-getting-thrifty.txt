Popped into the thrift store today, just to see what I could find. I
like looking for new VHS movies to import or older technology I can
rescue, but today... I stumbled upon a treasure trove of semi-modern
gadgets for a tenth what they would cost on eBay. For myself, I
picked up a Netgear Nighthawk and Sonos 3 for less than $40; a haul
so good I had to double check that I wasn't inadvertently robbing a
Best Buy.

Oh, and just in case you are curious, they both work perfectly.
Aside from those two things, though, there were digital cameras,
mechanical keyboards, a shelf of new video games, and a handful of
other similar items. I can only assume that some poor kid made his
mom angry enough to donate his gear to the local Arc as punishment.

On an unrelated note, I also picked up a new-to-me General Electric
Clock/Radio/Telephone (to go with my Sony CRT, of course). I've
been dreaming of setting up an Asterisk box for a while now, and
this seemed like the *perfect* piece to start with... unfortunately,
it turned out to be a pulse-dialing phone, so now I have to pick
up a pulse-to-tone converter.

So, while I wait for that to come in, I'll be turning my Raspberry
Pi into an FM transmitter and broadcasting the absurdity that is
the Art Bell Radio Archive [0] to the "Radio" part of my little GE
box, because why the hell not, right?
