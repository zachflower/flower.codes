Years ago, before Google and I stopped seeing eye-to-eye, I bought
an Asus Chromebook C100P. It's a great, cheap little machine with
mediocre specs and decent battery life that was good for browsing
the web and not much else. I had originally intended to get a
lightweight laptop for writing away from my desk, but the simplicity
of Chrome OS just wasn't enough for me, so this little guy has been
sitting in a drawer for the better part of three years.

But, I hate waste.

I hate that I have a perfectly good machine sitting around doing
nothing, and I hate that I have been allowing it to languish for so
long. Thankfully, the Gopherverse has given me a renewed drive to
create new value out of the old tech in my life, so I've spent the
last few days looking into options for reviving this thing and
extracting more value out of it.

After a few false starts installing Arch and Debian on an external
SD card (spoiler: it works, but not in a way that is useful), I came
across Crouton [0], a brilliant little project that lets you run
Linux in a chroot on a Chromebook.

I won't go into the installation steps, as the Crouton GitHub page
does a great job walking you through that process, but I *will* say
that everything works out of the gate without any issue. With some
experimentation, I landed on a simple LXDE desktop environment
running Ubuntu Xenial (I know, old school, but so far I'm only using
this thing to write *this* phlog post.

I'll figure out what more to do with it later, but in the mean time
it'll serve nicely as little portable gopher clienet.
