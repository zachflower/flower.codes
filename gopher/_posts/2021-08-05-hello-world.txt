Guess it's time to give this gopher thing a try. TBH, I've waffled between
setting up a Gemini Capsule or Gopherhole for quite a while, but ultimately
settled on Gopher because Lynx supports the Gopher protocol and not Gemini.

I know a lot of folks have moved on to Gemini recently, so I'm probably late to
the game, but at least this way I can continue down the path of keeping my
internet presence accessible on legacy systems.

In researching the "hows" and "whats" of the Gopherspace, it seemed to me like
a lot of recent adopters mirror their websites and blogs onto their Gopherholes.
I don't want to do this. Instead, I am going to try and use this space as a
separate and distinct one, where I will likely write about legacy/vintage/retro
technologies.

Or I'll forget it exists and let it starve to death.

In any event, it'll be fun to figure out.
