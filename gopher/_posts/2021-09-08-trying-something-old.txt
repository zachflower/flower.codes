I've been experimenting with offline-first technology lately.
Typewriters, cassette decks, Game Boys... I like single-purpose
tools that can't distract, divert, or otherwise take my attention
away from what I am doing -- seriously, why the hell does a fridge
need an internet connection?

One thing I have had trouble extricating myself from, though, was
*writing*.

I like to write.

I do it for both fun and money, but thanks to "The Interwebs," It's
been difficult to find a good, non-analog solution. At least, until
now.

Thanks to the advice of an article that I didn't have the foresight
to bookmark, I picked up an AlphaSmart 3000 [0] on eBay for a
shockingly small amount of money. It's a simple little device that
you can basically do nothing but write on, and -- aside from the
flashbacks to using one to do all of my homework after breaking my
arm in the 6th grade -- I absolutely love it.

At this exact moment, I am writing this post on my new AlphaSmart
3000 from the comfort of my back patio, and will eventually transfer
it to my computer and upload it to my phlog (as soon as it is
convenient, at least).

Until then, I will be enjoying some time with my kids.
