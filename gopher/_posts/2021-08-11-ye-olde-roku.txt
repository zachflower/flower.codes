I have a weird appreciation for "upgrading" old (see: obsolete)
technology. I don't know what, exactly, but there's just something
completely satisfying about surfing the wave between the past and
the present. In one sense, finding ways to extend the life-span of
aging tech is exciting; but, in a completely different sense, the
sheer novelty of actually accomplishing it is a reward in its own
right.

Now, I won't pretend I'm actually *good* at this sort of thing, but
it's fun nonetheless; so I try (or at least dream), which is why
my home office is littered with aging and obsolete electronics.
Floppy drives, VHS players, CRT televisions, vintage video game
systems... you name it, I've probably got something like it laying
around.

One piece that I'm particularly fond of is a black and white 1977
Sony CVM-131 television that, surprisingly, still works. Thanks to
a ridiculous daisy chain of transformers and modulators, I have been
able to connect an early-generation Roku 1 SE [0] to it and (with
varying levels of success) watch my favorite online content in
sweet, sweet desaturated standard definition.

The one thing that I haven't been able to get working, until
recently at least, was my own local content. Thanks to the magic
of TV tuners, I have digitized every VHS I own, but there's no
better experience than watching them on the CRT televisions they
were made for.

Plex [1], a service my family is a big fan of for its ease of use,
does *not* run well on the SE. In fact, it is downright unusable.
While you can browse the content, it spends nearly all of its time
buffering. So, I thought I'd give something simpler a try. For the
uninitiated, Jellyfin [2] is an open source alternative to Plex with
just as many bells and whistles, but a smaller footprint.

And, wouldn't you know it? It works *beautifully!* For the better
part of the last few days I have been able to stream everything I
want from my personal library with nary a loading screen to be seen.
I know that it isn't practical, but at least I've been able to save
a few less-than-useful gadgets from the landfill
