32-bit isos are starting to drop off the map (Lubuntu, for example, doesn't offer one anymore, and Bodhi's is a version behind).

# Bodhi Linux 5.1.0

- _Everything_ worked out of the box (pen, wifi, etc), even in the installer
- Browser was unusable (most sites simply didn't load, even with JS turned off)
- UI is _ugly_

# Debian 11

- Wifi (ipw2100-1.3.fw) didn't work
- Pen didn't work
- Wired network autoconfiguration failed, had to go with manual configuration
- After installation is completed, pen works (yay), no wifi though
- Included Firefox is so slow it's practically unusable

# Gentoo

- Decided to make my life more difficult (and reminisce while I'm at it)
- DHCP still didn't work out of the gate, but manual config worked again
- Live CD _did_ pick up the wifi module, though
- I forgot how long this process takes...
- ... now that I think about it, I think it took _3_ days to install Gentoo the first time around (granted, that was 20 years ago)
- Alright, updating th `@world` set froze at some point in the middle of the night. Rebooting, rechrooting, resyncing, and trying again. Hopefully it'll pick up where it left off...
- ... yay, it did.
