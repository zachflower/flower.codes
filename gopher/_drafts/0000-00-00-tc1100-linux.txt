- 60GB HDD
- 800MHz Ultra-Low Voltage Intel Celeron Processor
- 1.25GB RAM
- NVIDIA GeForce 4 Go 420
- Wireless (only a/b/g supported, sloooowww)
- Bluetooth (yay)
- Oh, there's also a "digital" stylus (meaning this baby isn't a touch screen, but one of those pre-iPad Wacom-style tablet computers)

32-bit isos are starting to drop off the map (Lubuntu, for example, doesn't offer one anymore, and Bodhi's is currently a version behind).

>>> Attempt #1: Bodhi Linux 5.1.0

- _Everything_ worked out of the box (pen, wifi, etc), even in the installer
- Browser was unusable (most sites simply didn't load, even with JS turned off)
- UI is _ugly_

>>> Attempt #2: Debian 11

- Wifi (ipw2100-1.3.fw) didn't work
- Wired network auto-configuration failed, had to go with manual configuration
- Pen works (yay), no wifi though
- Included Firefox is so slow it's practically unusable

>>> Attempt #3: Gentoo

- Decided to make my life more difficult (and reminisce while I'm at it)
- DHCP still didn't work out of the gate, but manual config worked again
- Live CD _did_ pick up the wifi module, though
- I forgot how long this process takes...
- ... now that I think about it, I think it took _3_ days to install Gentoo the first time around (granted, that was 20 years ago)
- Alright, updating th `@world` set froze at some point in the middle of the night. Rebooting, rechrooting, resyncing, and trying again. Hopefully it'll pick up where it left off...
- ... yay, it did.
- And it failed again after trying to compile rust for 36 hours

>>> Attempt #4: Q4OS 4.7

- Hah, there is a "NO questions, FULL automated installation" option
- Going to go with "Classic install," though
- Oh hey, the installer wizard isn't graphical, that's a nice change of pace, feels *super* responsive in comparison to the Debian and Bodhi installers
- Install complete!
- Pen works, sound works
- Wifi detected but all connections time out
- Konquerer browser installed by default, which works just great

>>> Attempt #5: Void Linux

- Damn thing wouldn't even boot

>>> Attempt #6: antiX 21

- Fastest boot into installation media so far
- Fastest installation process by far
- Pen works, wifi works
- Firefox works, but is painfully slow, replaced with the non-SSE2 version of Palemoon

>>> Attempt #7: Windows XP (Tablet Edition)

- Fuck it. Despite almost 20 years of lead-time, Linux is still practically unusable on this thing. At this point it's not worth the effort if I'm going to lose out on all the tablet-y features that make it cool to begin with.
- That said, I do have an old Dell Latitude 2200 that would be *far* less finicky.
