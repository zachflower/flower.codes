# the environment

Dell Inspiron 2200 + Fedora Core 4 (both ca 2005)

why those?

because it's what i had laying around. i did have other os choices, but decided to go with the one that was released around the same time as the laptop

# installation notes
- selected dell 1024x768 laptop lcd as monitor

# fixing the package manager
cd /etc/yum.repos.d

grep "enabled=1" *
fedora-extras.repo:enabled=1
fedora.repo:enabled=1
fedora-updates.repo:enabled=1

comment out mirrorlist
uncomment baseurl
replace with:
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/ => http://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/

run yum update

voila!
