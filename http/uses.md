## Hardware

### Desk

- [Husky Adjustable Height Workbench](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-46-in-Adjustable-Height-Work-Table-HOLT46XDB12/301809931) with a large [VIVO Keyboard Tray](https://amzn.com/B07HFDJCSL)
  - If you're in the market for a convertible standing desk, this combination is _significantly_ more affordable.
- AKRacing Core Series EX gaming chair
  - In 2020, I started experiencing severe neck pain and numbness in my shoulder that turned out to be caused by a slipped disc (fun). This chair provides surprisingly good back and head support for the price, and gives me somewhere to lean back when my spine needs a break.
- Ergodriven Topo Comfort standing desk mat
  -  When my desk is in a standing position, this mat keeps me moving and helps reduce fatigue in my legs and feet.

### Computers

- MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012) running macOS
  - I've had this laptop for nearly a decade now, and to be honest I can't ever see myself upgrading.
- Custom Desktop Computer running Windows 10
  - This is my daily driver. While Windows has its drawbacks, I enjoy the versatility it brings thanks to WSL2.
- Dell Inspiron 2200 running Fedora Core 4
  - Released in 2005, this laptop is my "not dead yet" box. It's my go-to Gopher machine, and has a bunch of obsolete browsers installed on it so I can make sure my website works _everywhen_.
- Apple iPad (7th Generation) + [Logitech Slim Folio](https://amzn.com/B07YFFKH27)

### Miscellaneous

- Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer - I don't know about you, but if my coffee doesn't stay warm I drink it _way_ too fast.
- Nighthawk R7000 + DD-WRT - Quite possibly the best thrift store find I've had. Awesome router, with an even awesomer (awesomest?) firmware.
- Sonos PLAY:3 - The _second_ best thrift store find I've had. Still works, and sounds fantastic.
- Nintendo Switch
- 13" [Sharp AQUOS LC-13S1U-S](https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16889101028) standard definition LCD TV with a Roku 1

## Software

### Desktop

- Visual Studio Code - I've bounced around all the popular IDEs over the years, but Visual Studio Code has definitely won out in terms of features, usability, and performance.
- Mozilla Firefox - Chromium is eating the web. Firefox FTW.
- iTerm2 and Windows Terminal
- Mozilla Thunderbird
- SizeUp
- TablePlus

### Terminal

- `vim` - I like the versatility of Visual Studio Code in a graphical environment, but in the command line (or on my ridiculously outdated Dell Latitude), Vim is _the_ editor.
- `homebrew`
- `tintin++`
- `bat`

### Mobile

- Prologue - Prologue is an _incredible_ audiobook app for Plex libraries.
- Libby
- Working Copy
- Reeder
- Prompt

### Self-Hosted

- Plex
- Jellyfin
- Adguard Home

## Travel

### Bags

- Topo Designs Quick Pack

### Devices

- Apple iPhone XS Max
- Nokia 225
- Apple AirPods
- Apple iPod Classic
- Skullcandy Venue - I picked these wireless over-ear headphones up a few years back on clearance, and to be honest I'm super glad I did. They sport a simple design, decent active noise cancelling, and built-in Tile tracking, which is pretty cool.
- Kindle Paperwhite - I haven't tried any other e-readers, so I can't speak to how well the Kindle stacks up, but what it _does_ have going for it (besides the backlight) is how well it integrates with Libby.
- YubiKey 5
- Tile - I keep a tile in my bag, not because I think it'll help me recover it if it gets stolen, but because I think it'll help me recover it when I inevitably forget it at a coffee shop or airport security (which totally hasn't happened to me before).
- Game Boy Color - What can I say, I'm a sucker for Pokemon Red. The lack of an internet connection is a bonus too.
