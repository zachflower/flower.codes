## Hardware

### Desk

- Husky Adjustable Height Work Table - Convertible standing desks are expensive, but you know what's not _quite_ so expensive? This guy.
- VIVO Keyboard Tray - The black metal matches the aesthetic of the Husky work table and keeps the desktop free of clutter.
- AKRacing Core Series EX Gaming Chair - In 2020, I started experiencing severe neck pain and numbness in my shoulder that turned out to be caused by a slipped disc (fun). This chair provides surprisingly good back and head support for the price, and gives me somewhere to lean back when my spine needs a break.
- Topo Comfort Mat -  When my desk is in a standing position, this mat keeps me moving and helps reduce fatigue in my legs and feet.

### Computers

- MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012) running macOS - I've had this laptop for nearly a decade now, and to be honest I can't ever see myself upgrading.
- Custom Desktop Computer running Windows 10 - This is my daily driver. While Windows has its drawbacks, I enjoy the versatility it brings thanks to WSL2.
- Dell Inspiron 2200 running Fedora Core 4 - Released in 2005, this laptop is my "not dead yet" box. It's my go-to Gopher machine, and has a bunch of obsolete browsers installed on it so I can make sure my website works _everywhen_.
