I've always loved the concept behind a [/uses](https://uses.tech/) page, but as someone who swaps out everything from my watch to my computer on a near-daily basis, I've struggled with a maintainable format. But, not one to let minutiae stop me, I've decided to give it another try. This time, instead of listing everything I _could_ use at any given moment, I'll maintain a tighter list of everything I _love_ (or at least _like_) to use.

## Hardware

- **Apple MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012)** - I absolutely love this laptop. It's got a few nicks and dings, and the battery needs to be replaced, but otherwise it [still works _beautifully_](/2022/04/10/planned-obsolescence.html).
- **Apple iPhone XS Max** - The only complaint I have about this phone is that it's too damn big, but otherwise it is stable and performant. My phone and I have been on a journey to discover the line between [utility and distraction](https://flower.codes/2022/05/02/i-hate-my-smartphone.html) lately, but I think we've finally found some balance.
- **Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)** - As far as earbuds go, these are comfortable and sound great. The auto-pause and double-tap functionality are also a useful way to interact with what I'm listening to while keeping my ~~box of distractions~~ phone out of sight.

## Accessories

- **Timbuk2 Custom Prospect Messenger Bag** - I found this baby at a thrift store and it's been a great work bag. Nicely organized, durable, and looks great.
- **Korin Design ClickPack Pro** - I _also_ found this bag at a thrift store, and use it for travel and other non-work purposes. It holds a _ton_, maintains a consistent shape, and has some killer anti-theft features.
- **Casio Data Bank Watch (Silver _and_ Gold)** - I received my first Data Bank as a gift several years ago, and I [haven't worn an Apple Watch](/2022/05/07/offline-first.html) since.
- **Pilot G2 Pens** - These are the best ballpoint pens ever made. Period.

## Entertainment

- **Apple iPod Classic (5th Generation)**
- **Sony Walkman (WM-FX-421)**
- **Nintendo Game Boy Color (Atomic Purple)**
- **Nintendo Switch**

## Software

- **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**
  - GitLens
  - SynthWave '84
  - PHP DocBlocker
  - PHP Intelephense
  - Better Comments
  - Rainbow CSV
- **Microsoft Windows XP** - Look, I get it, Windows XP has been dead for a _very_ long time now, but it's still my absolute favorite version of Windows. I still pull out the 'ole HP Compaq tablet when I'm feeling particularly nostalgic (which is pretty often lately) and play around.
  - **New Moon** - New Moon is a modern, Windows XP compatible fork of Pale Moon, which is itself an old fork of Mozilla Firefox. Browsing the modern web on Windows XP isn't exactly the world's safest thing to do, but at least New Moon makes it possible.
  - **RoAClient** - I've been [fascinated by MUDs](https://mudcoders.com/) since the late 90's, and in many ways owe my entire career as a software engineer to them. RoAClient is _not_ the best MUD client ever made, nor is it the most polished, but it is the first one I ever used and has cemented itself as my personal favorite.
- **Gitea** - I've been slowly but surely migrating all of my GitHub repositories to my own self-hosted Gitea instance (including [this website](https://git.crlf.wtf/zach/flower.codes)). Definitely feels good to be more in control of my code projects.
- **Drone CI** - After moving away from GitHub, I needed to find a replacement for GitHub Actions, and Drone has definitely fit the bill. Easy to configure and use, and (most importantly) no "build minute" limits.
- **Miniflux** - Everyone knows that Google Reader was one of the best Google products ever released, and while Feedly is a perfectly suitable replacement, I prefer something a little more slimmed down (and private). Miniflux is my favorite option of the bunch.
- **Reeder** - Miniflux doesn't have a mobile client, but Reeder on iOS is a fantastic alternative that can connect to Miniflux directly.
- **AdGuard Home** - I get it, Pi-holes are all the rage lately, but AdGuard home does the same thing with a significantly better user interface. It also seems to be more stable on my Raspberry Pi than Pi-hole was.

## Services

- **Plex** - I've been a Plex member for a _very_ long time, and absolutely love the service. Some people aren't a fan of the "add-ons," like podcasts, streaming TV, and Crackle integrations, but those are easy enough to turn off, and the usability itself is excellent.
- **Evernote** - I have always struggled with choosing a notes app. Over the years, I've used OneNote, Simplenote, Obsidian, Notion, and a handful of others, and no matter how hard I try I always end up right back at Evernote. The editor isn't the absolute _best_ (I would love better Markdown support), but the support for managing and parsing external files is _fantastic_.
- **Instapaper** - I've cycled through just about every "read later" service out there, from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/) to [Wallabag](https://www.wallabag.it/en), but Instapaper is by far my favorite. It's simple, easy to use, and doesn't try to push social sharing too hard.
- **Readwise** - As someone who reads [a _lot_ of books](/library.html) on Kindle, re-exposing myself to notes I've taken over the years is super valuable. Readwise pulls those notes in automagically, and sends me a daily digest of old and new highlights to review. I'm still currently evaluating Readwise, but so far I like it.
- **Snipd** - I used to be a _die hard_ [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) fan, but Snipd's ability to intelligently save slices of a podcast episode has converted me. As of right now, the only thing I miss from Pocket Casts is the auto-archive functionality, but I can definitely live without that.
