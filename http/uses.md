I've always loved the concept behind a [/uses](https://uses.tech/) page, but as someone who swaps out everything from my watch to my computer on a near-daily basis, I've struggled with a maintainable format. But, not one to let minutiae stop me, I've decided to give it another try. This time, instead of listing everything I _could_ use at any given moment, I'll maintain a tighter list of everything I _love_ (or at least _like_) to use.

## Hardware

- **Apple MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012)** - I absolutely love this laptop. It's got a few nicks and dings, and the battery needs to be replaced, but otherwise it [still works _beautifully_](/2022/04/10/planned-obsolescence.html).
- **Apple iPhone XS Max** - The only complaint I have about this phone is that it's too damn big, but otherwise it is stable and performant. My phone and I have been on a journey to discover the line between [utility and distraction](https://flower.codes/2022/05/02/i-hate-my-smartphone.html) lately, but I think we've finally found some balance.
- **Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)** - As far as earbuds go, these are comfortable and sound great. The auto-pause and double-tap functionality are also a useful way to interact with what I'm listening to while keeping my ~~box of distractions~~ phone out of sight.

## Services

- **Plex** - I've been a Plex member for a _very_ long time, and absolutely love the service. Some people aren't a fan of the "add-ons," like podcasts, streaming TV, and Crackle integrations, but those are easy enough to turn off, and the usability itself is excellent.
- **Evernote** - I have always struggled with choosing a notes app. Over the years, I've used OneNote, Simplenote, Obsidian, Notion, and a handful of others, and no matter how hard I try I always end up right back at Evernote. The editor isn't the absolute _best_ (I would love better Markdown support), but the support for managing and parsing external files is _fantastic_.
- **Instapaper** - I've cycled through just about every "read later" service out there, from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/) to [Wallabag](https://www.wallabag.it/en), but Instapaper is by far my favorite. It's simple, easy to use, and doesn't try to push social sharing too hard.
- **Readwise**
- **Snipd** - I used to be a _die hard_ [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) fan, but Snipd's ability to intelligently save slices of a podcast episode has converted me. As of right now, the only thing I miss from Pocket Casts is the auto-archive functionality, but I can definitely live without that.

## Accessories

- **Timbuk2 Custom Prospect Messenger Bag** - I found this baby at a thrift store and it's been a great work bag. Nicely organized, durable, and looks great.
- **Korin Design ClickPack Pro** - I _also_ found this bag at a thrift store, and use it for travel and other non-work purposes. It holds a _ton_, maintains a consistent shape, and has some killer anti-theft features.
- **Casio Data Bank Watch (Silver _and_ Gold)** - I received my first Data Bank as a gift several years ago, and I [haven't worn an Apple Watch](/2022/05/07/offline-first.html) since.
- **Pilot G2 07 Pens** - These are the best ballpoint pens ever made.
