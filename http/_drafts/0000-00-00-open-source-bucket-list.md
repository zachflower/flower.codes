I'm not ashamed to admit that I don't usually contribute to open source as a way of giving back to the community for everything it has given me. Don't get me wrong, it's a great side effect, but the reason that I do it is because _it makes me feel good_.

That's it.

Not the most altruistic of motives, I know.

A long time ago, I jotted down a bucket list of sorts containing all of the open source projects I would love to make my mark on. There's something about building something that thousands of other engineers might get value out of that is really satisfying, so I went about making a list of all of the open source projects that I actively use.

The list (while not complete), looked something like this:

- [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)
- [Vagrant](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant)
- [PHP](https://github.com/php/php-src)
- [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/)
- [Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer)
