I'm not ashamed to admit that I don't usually contribute to open source as a way of giving back to the community for everything it has given me. Don't get me wrong, it's a great side effect, but the reason that I do it is because _it makes me feel good_.

That's it.

A long time ago, I jotted down a bucket list of sorts containing all of the open source projects I would love to make my mark on.
