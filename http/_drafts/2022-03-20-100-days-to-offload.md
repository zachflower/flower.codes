You know what I like? Arbitrary challenges.

- Journaling every day? Done.
- Create an aggressively backwards compatible website? Let's do it.
- Read one book every week until you die? Sign me up.

There's something about a goalpost that has no reason to exist except _to exist_ that motivates me in a way that important things like deadlines, due dates, and appointments generally fail to do. Which is why the [100 Days to Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge really speaks to me.

## The Rules

In case you are unfamiliar with the challenge, here are the rules:

> - This needs to be done on a personal blog, not a corporate blog. If you don’t have a personal blog, you can sign up for a free one at Write.as.
> - There is no specific start date. Your 100 posts can start or end whenever you want them to.
> - Publish 100 new posts in the space of a year.
> - There are no limits to what you can post about – write about whatever interests you.

Seeing as I've got a personal blog and a motivation to write on it a _hell_ of a lot more, this is right up my alley.

## Ready. Set. Go.

Now, I should mention that I won't be following the trend of tagging the articles for the challenge. I think it's safe to assume that any article published between now and *\*checks watch\** March 20th, 2023 will apply to the designated total.

And, because it doesn't feel very sporting otherwise, this article will be considered #0 in the series. 100 fresh posts; about two a week for the next 52 weeks. That's the goal, and that's what I'm going to shoot for.
