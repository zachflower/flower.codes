Welcome to my 2021 retrospective!

I know, I know... another "end of the year post" to add to the heaps already
published by far more interesting people than myself. But, if there's anything
I've learned over the last two years, it's that reflection is one of the most
effective ways to grow.

After 2020, this past year brought me far more good than it did bad, the key
points of which I will discuss below, but before I do that, there are a few
things that I will _not_ be wasting time on. The first is COVID-19. Enough has
been said about it already that I'll leave my end-of-year thoughts at this:
vaccines good, variants bad. Extrapolate what you want from that, as it's all
I'll say.

Another subject I won't be spending much time on is work. I changed jobs,
leaving one that was easy but toxic for another that is challenging but
rewarding. I have no intention of putting either company in the spotlight,
because that's not what this post is about. If you are hankerin' for some hot
goss, you're welcome to shoot me an email, but otherwise I think we can leave
that subject for another day.

Now, on to the retro!

## The Good

Like I said, 2021 dealt me far more good cards than bad, and in the spirit of
embracing positivity first, I'm going to talk about those first.

### Reading Tracking

At the beginning of the year, I came across a personal page on
[tilde.town](https://tilde.town) cataloging a user named `~dustin`'s
[reading](https://tilde.town/~dustin/wiki/library/) for the last several years.
I loved the concept so much that I blatantly [ripped it off](/library) for my
own site. I enjoyed tracking my own reading so much that I blew my goal out of
the water, completing over 80 books of varying lengths.

The experiment was such a success that I've more than doubled last year's goal
and will be continuing it for the foreseeable future. And, not to leave anyone
guessing, of the 80 books I read last year, here are some of my top favorites
(in no particular order):

- **[Goodbye Phone, Hello World](https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=1452184526) by Paul Greenberg**
  Like most of us, I seriously struggled with phone addiction in 2020. The
  doomscrolling seriously affected my mental health, and generally ruined my
  outlook on life, so I started 2021 off by reading a book to help me kick the
  habit. An easy read, **Goodbye Phone, Hello World** has a ton of great
  practical advice for breaking up with your phone and getting back out into
  reality.
- **[The Obstacle Is The Way](https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=1591846358) by Ryan Holiday**
  After spending a year letting my fears and anxieties get the best of me, I
  spent much of this year exploring better ways to manage them. **The Obstacle
  Is The Way** was one of the books that really changed the way I think, and
  was my introduction into the ancient philosophy of Stoicism. While books like
  **Meditations** and **Letters From A Stoic** are far more popular, Holiday's
  books are a much more approachable entrance into a philosophy that is as old
  as it is deep.
- **[Kill It with Fire](https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=9781718501188) by Marianne Bellotti**
  As a software developer, I've been through my fair share of "modernizations,"
  but nothing captures my experiences more accurately and clearly than Marianne
  Bellotti's **Kill It with Fire**. An _incredibly_ well-written book about
  modernizing legacy systems (and future-proofing modern ones), it has made the
  top of my list of "required reading" for my direct reports and mentees.
- **[Digital Minimalism](https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0525536515) by Cal Newport**
  Breaking up with your smartphone is one thing, but rethinking your entire
  approach to using technology is something else altogether. **Digital
  Minimalism** provides actionable steps to eliminating technology dependence,
  while at the same time not outlawing it all together. If you want to be more
  deliberate about how you use the technology in your life without having to
  live off-the-grid, this book is for you. 
- **[Gates of Fire](https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0553580531) by Steven Pressfield**
  One of the last books I read this year, **Gates of Fire** is a historical
  fiction about the Battle of Thermopylae (you know, the one the movie 300 was
  about). I've never been a big reader of the military genre, but this book was
  more of an exploration of courage than a recap of an ancient battle. To be
  honest, I'm surprised as anyone that it's on this list, but it turned out to
  be my favorite book of the entire year.

### Technology Reduction

If you read the list of books I enjoyed the most last year, then it should come
as no surprise to you that my efforts to reduce my technology dependence have
been a net-positive in my life. While this is more of a general mindset than
any specific event, making delibrate choices about the technology I use (and
don't use) has really helped me find my center. That said, I know that a lot of
people enjoy lists of clear examples, so here are a few things that were
particularly valuable:

- To go along with my reading habit, I leaned heavily into printed books. I
  didn't eliminate my Kindle, but I did make a conscious effort to stare at
  fewer screens throughout the day.
- I dusted off my old music players and made delibrate choices about what music
  I listened to. Having to select a specific CD, a tape, or a record made me
  appreciate the music listening experience far more than shuffling a 1,000
  song playlist and filling the background with "noise."
- Instead of using digital note-taking apps, I bought a couple dozen yellow
  legal pads and use those _before_ committing something to bits and bytes. In
  today's world, it's impossible to stay completely analog, but this at least
  allows me to move away from the computer and phone and really focus on what
  I'm writing and why. It's been so helpful that I've even dedicated a space in
  my office just for writing.
- I bought a feature phone from Nokia and transferred my old Google Voice
  number over to it. While real life has made it impossible to completely ditch
  my smart phone (I can't pay for parking, pick my kids up from school, or even
  see a restaurant menu without one), whenever possible I leave it at home and
  only carry my dumb phone with me. It's not a complete solution, but it is
  liberating nonetheless.
- My smartphone _stays in a drawer in my office_ for as much of the day as
  humanly possible. That means while I work, while I sleep, while I read, and
  for any other reason I can think of. There is no reason to have it in my
  pocket at all times, and the phrase "out of sight, out of mind" is more true
  than I expected.

### Intermittent Fasting

Those who know me know that I have struggled with serious digestive issues for
the better part of the last decade. I've tried everything from minimalistic
diets to meditation, and while there have been marginal improvements, it's
largely just become something I've learned to live with.

Until now, at least.

In September, I decided to give intermittent fasting a try. Not to help my
digestion, but I had been reading about it and thought it might be a healthier
alternative to the binge eating I have gotten accustomed to. Turns out, it has
worked _wonders_ on my gut. For the first time in _years_, I was able to go on
a vacation and enjoy _every single second_ of it.

I'm not sure why it's been so helpful, but it has seriously changed my life in
ways that I couldn't have possibly imagined.

### Self-Hosting

Back in college, I learned everything about networking. I ran everything from
web and email servers to name servers, and I loved every second of it. There
was something raw and magical about doing everything from scratch, and that's
what I tried to get back to in 2021.

It might seem counterintuitive to both reduce my technology dependence while
increasing technology use by self-hosting, but one of the methods I've adopted
for detoxing from tech is eliminating my dependence on the internet itself.
Self-hosting my own services is rewarding, and more importantly puts me in
control of my own destiny. By not being beholden to any external services, I
get to decide what I use and how. No unwanted notifications or "social"
features.

### Intentional Ignorance

In Tim Ferriss's **The 4-Hour Work Week**, he advocates for being generally
uninformed about the state of the world, and after 2020, being uninformed is
exactly what I needed. In 2021, I made a deliberate effort to be as ignorant as
possible about the world in order to save my sanity. Anything important that I
need to know finds its way to me through family and friends, while the
unimportant stuff leaves me alone.

24-hour news channels, social media, and everything else that claims to keep us
"informed" have done more harm to my mental health than good, so I have decided
that I'm done with it. If I need to know something (such as which candidates or
measures I support in an election), I'm still aware of how a search engine
works, but by not being constantly flooded with "news that isn't news," my life
has become far more peaceful.

## The Bad

Despite 2021 being a pretty good year overall, it wasn't all sunshine and
rainbows. A few things happened that I didn't particularly love and I'm still
dealing with in one way or another.

### Slipped Disc

After literal decades of hunching over a computer, my body finally said
"enough!" and slipped a disc in my neck. After months of pain and suffering
(and tests and scans and physical therapy and and and) it is a problem that is
_mostly_ under control, but there are still bad days.

Unfortunately, one of the best solutions I've found to manage the pain is to
work at a standing desk, which I absolutely hate. The good lord did not intend
for man to write software on his feet. It is inhuman. But, this is my life as I
get to live it right now, and if I'm being honest I'd rather have sore legs and
be able to play with my kids at the end of the day than live in excruciating
pain just to sit on my ass for eight hours at a stretch.

Word of advice: take care of your body. You only get one, and once you screw it
up, fixing it is painful, expensive, and time consuming.

### Burnout

I work way too damn much. With a day job, freelance writing, and freelance
software development, I seriously burned myself out this year. Some of that is
thanks to a toxic work culture I was able to escape from, some of it is because
the literal pain in the neck paying the bills has become, and some of it is
just because I have trouble saying "no" when an opportunity comes up.

Thankfully I've pulled back on a lot of my engagements, but I haven't zeroed
them out yet. As much as I'd love to work less, kids are expensive, and for the
time being I have gotten pretty good at turning my time into money. That said,
I would love to find a way to get some of that time back this year.

### Working from Home

I used to _love_ working from home. So much so that a generous remote working
policy was table stakes at any job I was applying for, but no more. The
pandemic was isolating enough that I desperately miss spending my days with
people I enjoy (and working with people I enjoy spending time with is high on
my list of priorities). I know it won't be forever, but damn if it isn't lonely
sometimes (even with a house full of kids).

## The Beyond

Alright, enough reflecting. I didn't want this post to just be a recap of the
goods and bads of the last 12 months, but also a loosely-defined action plan
for some things I want to accomplish over the _next_ 12 months too.

To be clear, these aren't New Years Resolutions. Those don't work. They are
just a list of a few areas where I would like to grow and explore. If it
happens, great, and if not, well... at least I wrote something down, right?

### More Experimentation

At some point this past year, I discovered a list of [personal
experiments](https://www.raptitude.com/experiments/) by a man named David Cain
on his blog Raptitude. Like `~dustin`'s reading log, this list grabbed my
attention in a big way. While I may not be as diligent as David is at tracking
my own experiments, I plan on trying to at least do something similar in my own
way. A few ideas of 30-day daily experiments to start with:

- Work without listening to music
- Achieve and maintain Inbox Zero
- Go on a spending fast
- Use only command line interfaces
- Wear ankle weights
- Create and use a soundtrack for my life
- Meditate for 30 minutes

### Analog, Baby

I really want to get into more into analog... stuff. I have an old Canon AE-1
SLR that I've been wanting to learn how to use _well_, along with developing my
own film. Same thing goes for music, calendar and task management, art, driving
directions (remember maps?), letter writing, cooking, whatever. I like things
that make me slow down, so developing an even deeper appreciation for them is
really exciting for me.

### The Hard Path

This can probably go without saying, but I am incredibly lazy. Not unlike many
other software developers, I got into it as much because I liked automating
things that I didn't want to deal with almost as much as I liked the act of
writing software itself. It has served me well professionally, but in the same
vein as going analog to slow down and be more mindful, I want to deliberately
choose the hard path more often. From doing the job instead of hiring it out to
someone else, to increasing the challenge of things I already know how to do, I
want to find new ways to grow and strengthen my mind and body. Or, to
paraphrase Theodore Roosevelt, I want to start wearing out and stop rusting
out.
