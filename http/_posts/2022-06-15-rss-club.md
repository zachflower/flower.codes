About a month back, I subscribed to [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/)'s RSS feed and noticed that there were a handful of posts that didn't exist on his website. Turns out, Dave has created something called RSS Club that provides _RSS-only_ content. In his words:

> It’s like a newsletter delivered to your feed reader in order to celebrate the medium of RSS and breakaway from social media.

I love this.

Amazingly, a number of writers I already follow have joined RSS club (even though I somehow have failed to notice their RSS-only posts), and I am _thrilled_ to join their ranks. So, to kick things off, consider this my very first post in RSS Club, and for the sake of clarity, I feel like I should end it with the three rules of RSS Club:

- 1st rule of RSS Club is "Don’t Talk About RSS Club".
- 2nd rule of RSS Club is "Don’t Share on Social Media".
- 3rd rule of RSS Club is "Provide Value".

**Oh!** And for the record, this blog runs on Jekyll, so I just followed Dave's guidance on [this page](https://daverupert.com/2018/01/welcome-to-rss-club/) with one minor tweak:

```html
{% raw %}{% if page.rss_only %}
  <!-- don't index rss club posts -->
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex" />
{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

If the posts are for RSS feeds only, I don't want them being discovered and indexed by all of the search engines of the world, so I added a `noindex` meta tag to my RSS-only headers too.

Simple, but effective.
