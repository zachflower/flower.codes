title: "4 Tired Developer Debates That Need to Just Die Already"

I’ve  never been a particularly confrontational person. In the workplace, I  would much rather maintain good relationships with my coworkers than  engage in endless debates over something that ultimately doesn’t benefit  the product or the team.

Unfortunately,  software developers love to argue. Whether it is about style, tooling,  or entire operating systems, we are stubborn, intelligent creatures with  the misfortune of believing our opinions count as facts (spoiler alert: they don’t).

The  flame wars don’t matter, and while some debates can be healthy, there  are four in particular that I wish would just end already.

## 1. Indentation Styles

Probably  one of the more contentious — yet least valuable — debates on this  list, indentation styles are a nightmare to talk about. Tabs. No,  spaces. 4 of them. Or maybe 2.

Seriously, kill me now.

Highlighted  in an early episode of Silicon Valley, the tabs vs. spaces debate is a  self-centered one that completely ignores the realities of language and  framework patterns, best practices, and long-term project  maintainability. Everybody has a preference — personally, I like spaces  (also known as soft-tabs, for those of you that think preferring spaces  means I hit the spacebar ten-thousand times a day) — but personal  preference has no place in a team setting.

Code,  like writing, should read like it comes from a singular voice. That  means, regardless of what you prefer, the code that you create should  adhere to the standards of the project. What it doesn’t mean is that you have to actually change your coding habits. When it  comes to consistency, guardrails are your friend. Projects like [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) exist to apply consistency to your project’s formatting. Spaces, tabs,  newlines. Whatever you prefer is fine, because in the end the guardrails  you implement can take care of the details.

## 2. Tools

In  2013, I accepted a job at a well-known hosting company after spending  the previous two years at a very early stage startup. Excited to learn  what I could from a larger, better funded organization, I was instead  greeted by a barrage of technological gatekeeping. One of the first  “conversations” I had with one of my new coworkers — and onboarding  buddy — was a backhanded review of my editor of choice.

“You’ll never be productive with Editor X,” he said, “we only use Editor Y here.”

Three months later, I quit for decidedly greener pastures.

Whether  it is Vim vs. Emacs, IDE vs. Text Editor, GUI vs. CLI, or some other  arbitrary “this vs. that” debate, the tools we use as developers largely  don’t matter. When you claim that you are better at your job than  someone else because of the tools that you use, then you are admitting that it’s not you that is doing the job at all. As the saying goes, “a good carpenter doesn’t blame his tools.”

## 3. Technology Stacks

If  I have to hear one more argument over which programming language or  database technology is best, I’m going to lose it. Don’t get me wrong,  I’m a firm believer in using the right tool for the job, but sometimes  we have to operate using the knowledge that we simply don’t know which tool is right for a particular job. But we, as developers, often confuse what we understand and are good at with what is “best.”

C++ is no better or worse than Java.

Ruby on Rails and Laravel each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

NoSQL and Relational databases are not one-size-fits-all.

Whether it is due to time or budget crunch, more often than not the choice in  technology stack is less important than the outcome. Why let perfect get  in the way of good? Pick the right choice for right now, and recognize that technology is always changing.  You will be able to evolve your product alongside it, but arguing over  which stack is better than the rest will get you nowhere.

## 4. Operating Systems

Remember the old “I’m a Mac. I’m a PC.” commercials?

I do. And I hate them.

They  imply that your operating system of choice makes you an inherently  better or more productive person, which simply isn’t the case.  Preference is exactly that: preference. It’s what works for you.  On any given day, I use all three major operating systems. I’m  comfortable jumping from Windows to macOS to Linux and back, because the  operating system that I use doesn’t matter nearly as much to me as it  used to.

Unfortunately, that doesn’t stop die-hard OS enthusiasts from re-sparking this debate.

But  the reality is that we live in a world where cross-platform is now  table-stakes. Nearly every development tool that we use works across  just about every operating system you can imagine, so no one operating  system is any more productive than any other. Hell, thanks to  containerization, even development environments are becoming more  consistent across operating systems.

The only thing that working in macOS, Linux, or Windows proves is that you have a preference for a certain style.  Whether it is DIY, plug-and-play, or some combination of the two, the  operating system that you use is no better or worse than what someone  else uses; and before you join into the next flame war about it, I can  guarantee that as productive as you are in your own environment, your  opponent is just as productive in theirs.
