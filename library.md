<!-- inspired by http://tilde.town/~dustin/wiki/library/ -->

I used to read a lot. As a child, and then as a teenager, I almost always had my face in a book. If my personal habits over the last decade are of any indication, my appetite for literature was fueled by the lack of portable technology available to me in the 90's and early aughtsâ€”and as 2020 has taught all of us, what we need these days is _less_ tech, not more.

So, in support of my single 2021 resolution to "slow the fuck down," I'm going to replace my doomscrolling habit with a book-reading one, and what better way to do that than to hold myself accountable with a rolling log of books I have read? A book-logbook, if you will.

I should probably note that some of these books will be ones I've read dozens of times, while others will be one-and-dones (ones-and-done?). I'm sure there will be a few I don't even bother to finish, but it's my list and I'll do what I want with it. Also, it's important to acknowledge that some authors are great writers, but [less-than-great](https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/06/jk-rowling-trans-men-terf.html) [people](https://www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_orson_scott_card_hates_fan_fiction_the_homosexual_agenda_partner/). It shouldn't need to be said, but my choosing to read a book does not constitute support of an author's personal beliefs.
